# Number-Wizard
This repository's goal is to facilitate and document the development of the game Number Wizard (UI). 

The game is part of the Udemy course Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D. 

The gameplay is basically a GUI gamyfied version of a Binary Search method where the player thinks of a number and the computer "guesses" the number according to input from the player (My number is higher/lower).

This might be a nice tool to introduce kids who learn tech in school the concept of binary search.
